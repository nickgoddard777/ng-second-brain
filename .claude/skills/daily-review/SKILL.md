# /daily-review - End of Day Review

Compare planned vs actual for today.

## Steps

1. Read `daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` for today's plan
2. Run `git log --since="8am" --grep="cos:"` for activity
3. Find relevant tasks efficiently (don't read all tasks):
   - Search for tasks due today: `grep -l "due: YYYY-MM-DD" task/*.md`
   - Find task files modified today: `git diff --name-only HEAD@{8am}..HEAD -- task/`
4. Read only the relevant task files identified above
5. Update task statuses (`status: complete` for completed items)
6. Append review section to daily note
7. Commit: `cos: daily review for YYYY-MM-DD`

> **Archiving happens at the weekly review, not here.** Do not move tasks or projects to archive during the daily review.
